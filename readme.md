## Dropzoner - Laravel package for Dropzone 

This is work in progress and it is bare Laravel installation right now.

Idea is to have simplest package for Dropzone. You pull it via composer, set service provider and include it in your views with @include('dropzoner'). 
It will take full width of parent container, and will throw events on image upload/delete etc. 

If you have some ideas for features, just open issues here on GitHub or send me an email.
